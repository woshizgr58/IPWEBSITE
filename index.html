        <p>Ahh, instant ramen, a food that every college student has stocks of. You crave it before you eat it, but once you finish it, you’re hit with the post-instant-ramen-clarity: You think to yourself, “I’m not even full. This tastes the same every time. I’ve purchased many different flavors but it's so unhealthy. Why did I just eat that.” </p>
        <img class="pic" id="Pic1" src="./bigstock-Empty-Wallet-In-The-Hands-Of-A-361949482.jpg">
        <p>You’ve concluded that you want to eat out next time at a REAL ramen place or perhaps an Italian restaurant. The possibilities are endless, but you take a look at your wallet. You feel destroyed, humbled, and slightly embarrassed of your thoughts as your wallet reminds you that you’re a broke college student. </p>
        <p>However, Your wallet makes some suggestions, such as “maybe some McDonald’s? TacoBell? Burger King?” You know that those aren’t healthy options, but now you desperately need something to eat. Do you empty your wallet on one meal? Do you risk your health for some cheap fast food? Or do you open another pack of instant ramen?</p>
        <p>If you’ve ever found yourself in the above situation, I have a solution for you! </p>

        <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>The recipe I’m about to share is an instant ramen ramen-based recipe since you probably have that already. Essentially, it is a more advanced version of the ramen you’re probably familiar with. This recipe is also a lot more nutritious than instant ramen. </p>
        <h3>Who?</h3>
            <p>My primary target for this meal is college students who need a cheap, easy-to-make meal. You could be a potential future college student looking to get a glimpse of college life or anyone on a tight budget and needing a cheap and easy meal. </p>
        <h3>How?</h3>

            <p>The cool thing about this recipe is that you don’t need all the abovementioned ingredients. But if you really want to fill up your stomach, I would recommend at least having ground beef and eggs. The process is designed to be quick, so it shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes.

                <div class="container">
                    <div class="left">
                        <p>Pour water into your pan/pot, depending on how big your pan/pot is and how big your bowl is, and let the water boil. Don’t worry. You can always pour out excess water if you feel the need to. </p>

                <div class="container">
                    <div class="left">
                        <p>While the water is boiling, crack two eggs in a bowl and start mixing until you can no longer see the egg yolk. Add salt and pepper as necessary and a little soy sauce for added flavor.</p>

                    <div class="left">
                        <p>Add ground beef to a different bowl and stir with oil and soy sauce. Add salt and pepper as necessary. Stir till everything is evenly distributed. </p>
                        <p>Use a dedicated bowl and utensil when dealing with raw meat, and wash thoroughly after use! I don’t want anyone to get food poisoning

                    <div class="left">
                        <p>Once the water reaches a boiling point, unpack your ramen and put it in the pot. Wait for it to soften, you can test if it’s been softened by poking it with a fork or a spoon.</p>
                        <p>If your ramen of choice comes with a flavor pack, remember to take it out before putting it in! You don’t want it in boiling water and may want to use it later.

                    <div class="left">
                        <p>Pour egg, ground beef, and your vegetable of choice in after the ramen softens and let it sit for around 3-5 minutes. You can also add more soy sauce or salt for taste.</p>
                        <p>If your water stops boiling after you put the egg and the beef in, it’s okay! The cold nature of raw egg and ground beef may momentarily cool the water. It should be up to boiling point shortly.

                        <p>After around 3 minutes, take a small piece of ramen out and test if it’s cooked enough. You don’t want to overcook or undercook, but if it’s undercooked, you can just let it keep cooking.</p>

                        <p>Turn off your stove and let your ramen sit until the water stops boiling. Take out your ramen and enjoy your meal!</p>
                        <p>Optional: insert ramen pack and chili oil (if you can deal with a bit of spice) and stir accordingly. This will add to the taste!</p>
